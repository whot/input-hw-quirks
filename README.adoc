This repository tracks weird behaviors and bugs with input hardware. This
does not include invalid handling in user space, only hardware quirks that
need to be either fixed in the kernel or in userspace.

Hardware is tracked by manufacturer name, e.g. lenovo.adoc contains all
Lenovo devices. Built-in devices like touchpads are tracked by the
manufacturer of the device that contains that touchpad. i.e. a Synaptics
touchpad in a Lenovo machine will be in the Lenovo list.
